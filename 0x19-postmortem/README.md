## Concepts

For this project, we focus on the concept of on-call responsibilities and postmortems in software engineering.

## Background Context

In the world of software engineering, failures are inevitable. These failures can stem from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, or even human error. However, what's crucial is not the failure itself, but how we respond to it. Failing is normal and presents a valuable opportunity for learning and improvement. A great software engineer learns from their mistakes to prevent recurrence. 

A postmortem, also known as an incident report, is a widely used tool in the tech industry to analyze and document outages or incidents. It serves two main purposes:

1. To provide the organization's stakeholders with clear and concise information about the cause of the outage. This includes managers and executives who need to understand the impact of the incident on the business.
2. To ensure that the root cause(s) of the incident are identified and addressed, preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.
